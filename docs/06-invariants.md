# Business Invariants

## Overview

This document defines the business rules and invariants that must always hold true in the Kairos system. Invariants are constraints that cannot be violated regardless of the operation being performed.

## Habit Invariants

### H-1: Anchor Requirement

**Every habit must have an anchor behavior.**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Valid["✓ Valid Habits"]
        V1["Anchor: 'After brushing teeth'<br/>Type: AFTER_BEHAVIOR"]
        V2["Anchor: 'When I arrive at gym'<br/>Type: AT_LOCATION"]
        V3["Anchor: '7:00 AM'<br/>Type: AT_TIME"]
    end
    
    subgraph Invalid["✗ Invalid Habits"]
        I1["No anchor specified"]
        I2["Anchor: ''<br/>(empty string)"]
    end
    
    Valid --> |"Allowed"| Create["Create Habit"]
    Invalid --> |"Rejected"| Error["Validation Error"]
```

**Rule**: `habit.anchorBehavior != null && habit.anchorBehavior.isNotBlank()`

**Rationale**: Context-based triggers are fundamental to ADHD-friendly habit design. Time-based triggers are allowed but must be explicitly chosen.

---

### H-2: Category Assignment

**Every habit must belong to exactly one category.**

| Category | Time Association | Examples |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| MORNING | Before noon | Medication, exercise, breakfast routine |
| AFTERNOON | Noon to 6 PM | Work habits, lunch routine |
| EVENING | After 6 PM | Wind-down, preparation for next day |
| ANYTIME | No time constraint | Hydration, posture check |

**Rule**: `habit.category in [MORNING, AFTERNOON, EVENING, ANYTIME]`

---

### H-3: Phase Validity

**Habit phase must be valid for current status.**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state StatusActive {
        ONBOARD
        FORMING
        MAINTAINING
        LAPSED
        RELAPSED
    }
    
    state StatusPaused {
        PausedState: Any phase frozen
    }
    
    state StatusArchived {
        ArchivedState: Phase preserved
    }
    
    note right of StatusActive: All phases valid when ACTIVE
    note right of StatusPaused: Phase unchanged while paused
    note right of StatusArchived: Phase preserved for history
```

**Rules**:
- If `status == ACTIVE`, phase can be any value
- If `status == PAUSED`, phase is frozen (not updated)
- If `status == ARCHIVED`, phase is preserved (not updated)

---

### H-4: Partial Completion Always Allowed

**Partial completion cannot be disabled.**

**Rule**: `habit.allowPartialCompletion == true` (always)

**Rationale**: ADHD users struggle with perfectionism. Removing partial completion would reintroduce all-or-nothing thinking that causes abandonment.

**Note**: This field exists for potential future flexibility but currently must always be true.

---

### H-5: Threshold Ordering

**Relapse threshold must exceed lapse threshold.**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Valid["✓ Valid Thresholds"]
        V1["Lapse: 3, Relapse: 7"]
        V2["Lapse: 2, Relapse: 5"]
        V3["Lapse: 5, Relapse: 14"]
    end
    
    subgraph Invalid["✗ Invalid Thresholds"]
        I1["Lapse: 7, Relapse: 3"]
        I2["Lapse: 5, Relapse: 5"]
    end
```

**Rule**: `habit.relapseThresholdDays > habit.lapseThresholdDays`

**Rationale**: Lapse detection must occur before relapse to allow early intervention.

---

### H-6: Timestamp Consistency

**Lifecycle timestamps must be logically ordered.**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Created["createdAt"] --> Updated["updatedAt"]
    Created --> Paused["pausedAt"]
    Created --> Archived["archivedAt"]
    
    Paused -.-> |"if paused"| Archived
```

**Rules**:
- `habit.createdAt <= habit.updatedAt`
- `habit.pausedAt == null || habit.pausedAt >= habit.createdAt`
- `habit.archivedAt == null || habit.archivedAt >= habit.createdAt`
- If both set: `habit.pausedAt <= habit.archivedAt` (paused before archived)

---

## Completion Invariants

### C-1: Valid Completion Type

**Completion type must match the action taken.**

| Type | User Action | System Action |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| FULL | User taps "Done" | Never |
| PARTIAL | User taps "Partial" | Never |
| SKIPPED | User taps "Skip" | Never |
| MISSED | Never | System marks at day end |

**Rule**: MISSED completions can only be created by the lapse detection worker, never by direct user action.

---

### C-2: Partial Percentage Range

**Partial percentage must be between 1 and 99.**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Valid["✓ Valid Partial"]
        V1["type: PARTIAL<br/>partialPercent: 50"]
        V2["type: PARTIAL<br/>partialPercent: 1"]
        V3["type: PARTIAL<br/>partialPercent: 99"]
    end
    
    subgraph Invalid["✗ Invalid"]
        I1["type: PARTIAL<br/>partialPercent: 0"]
        I2["type: PARTIAL<br/>partialPercent: 100"]
        I3["type: PARTIAL<br/>partialPercent: null"]
        I4["type: FULL<br/>partialPercent: 50"]
    end
```

**Rules**:
- If `type == PARTIAL`: `1 <= partialPercent <= 99`
- If `type != PARTIAL`: `partialPercent == null`

---

### C-3: One Completion Per Habit Per Day

**A habit cannot have multiple completions for the same day.**

**Rule**: Unique constraint on `(habitId, date)`

**Exception**: Undo and redo operations replace the existing completion, they don't create a second one.

---

### C-4: No Future Completions

**Completions cannot be created for future dates.**

**Rule**: `completion.date <= today()`

---

### C-5: Limited Backdating

**Completions can only be backdated within 7 days.**

**Rule**: `completion.date >= today() - 7 days`

**Rationale**: Allows correcting recent oversights without enabling extensive history manipulation.

---

### C-6: Habit Must Exist

**Completion must reference an existing habit.**

**Rule**: `completion.habitId` references valid `Habit.id`

**Note**: Completions are preserved even if habit is archived—archive doesn't delete.

---

## Routine Invariants

### R-1: Minimum Habit Count

**A routine must contain at least 2 habits.**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Valid["✓ Valid Routines"]
        V1["2 habits"]
        V2["5 habits"]
        V3["10 habits"]
    end
    
    subgraph Invalid["✗ Invalid"]
        I1["0 habits"]
        I2["1 habit"]
    end
```

**Rule**: `routine.habits.count >= 2`

**Rationale**: A single habit doesn't need a routine—routines exist for sequencing multiple actions.

---

### R-2: Order Index Integrity

**Order indices must be sequential without gaps.**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Valid["✓ Valid Order"]
        V["Habit A: 0<br/>Habit B: 1<br/>Habit C: 2"]
    end
    
    subgraph Invalid["✗ Invalid Orders"]
        I1["Habit A: 0<br/>Habit B: 2<br/>(gap at 1)"]
        I2["Habit A: 1<br/>Habit B: 2<br/>(no 0)"]
        I3["Habit A: 0<br/>Habit B: 0<br/>(duplicate)"]
    end
```

**Rules**:
- `orderIndex` starts at 0
- No gaps in sequence
- No duplicate indices within a routine

---

### R-3: Habit Reference Validity

**RoutineHabit must reference an existing, active habit.**

**Rule**: `routineHabit.habitId` references `Habit` where `status != ARCHIVED`

**Handling**: When a habit is archived, warn user that it will be removed from routines, or prevent archive if habit is in routines.

---

### R-4: Positive Duration

**All durations must be positive.**

**Rule**: 
- `routineHabit.overrideDurationSeconds > 0` (if set)
- Referenced habit's `estimatedSeconds > 0`

---

### R-5: Variant Habit Subset

**Variant can only include habits that are in the parent routine.**

**Rule**: `routineHabit.variantIds` must all exist in `RoutineVariant` for the same routine.

---

## Execution Invariants

### E-1: Active Execution Uniqueness

**Only one routine execution can be IN_PROGRESS at a time.**

**Rule**: At most one `RoutineExecution` with `status == IN_PROGRESS` per user.

**Rationale**: User can only run one routine at a time.

---

### E-2: Step Index Bounds

**Current step index must be within routine bounds.**

**Rule**: `0 <= execution.currentStepIndex < routine.habits.count`

---

### E-3: Completion Creates Habit Completions

**When a routine completes, all non-skipped steps create habit completions.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Execution
    participant System
    participant DB
    
    Execution->>System: status = COMPLETED
    
    loop Each step
        alt Step was completed
            System->>DB: Create Completion(FULL) for habit
        else Step was skipped
            System->>DB: Create Completion(SKIPPED) for habit
        end
    end
```

**Rule**: Routine completion atomically creates completions for all habits in the routine.

---

## Recovery Invariants

### REC-1: Session Triggers at Threshold

**Recovery session created exactly when lapse threshold is reached.**

**Rule**: `RecoverySession` created when `consecutiveMissedDays == habit.lapseThresholdDays`

**Not before, not after**—exactly at threshold.

---

### REC-2: One Pending Session Per Habit

**A habit can have at most one PENDING recovery session.**

**Rule**: `RecoverySession.count(habitId, status=PENDING) <= 1`

---

### REC-3: Session Completion Requirements

**Completed session must have an action.**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Completed["status: COMPLETED"]
        C["action must be set"]
        C --> A1["RESUME"]
        C --> A2["SIMPLIFY"]
        C --> A3["PAUSE"]
        C --> A4["ARCHIVE"]
        C --> A5["FRESH_START"]
    end
    
    subgraph Pending["status: PENDING"]
        P["action is null"]
    end
    
    subgraph Abandoned["status: ABANDONED"]
        Ab["action is null"]
    end
```

**Rules**:
- If `status == COMPLETED`: `action != null`
- If `status == PENDING`: `action == null`
- If `status == ABANDONED`: `action == null`

---

### REC-4: Type Escalation

**Lapse can become relapse, but not vice versa.**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> LAPSE: 3 days missed
    LAPSE --> RELAPSE: 7 days reached
    RELAPSE --> [*]: Resolved
    
    note right of LAPSE: Can escalate
    note right of RELAPSE: Cannot de-escalate
```

**Rule**: If `type == RELAPSE`, it cannot change back to `LAPSE`.

---

## Sync Invariants

### S-1: Local Source of Truth

**Room database is the authoritative source; Firestore is sync/backup.**

**Rules**:
- All reads come from Room — UI never queries Firestore directly
- All writes go to Room first — then push to Firestore asynchronously
- Sync failure never blocks local operations
- No local data deleted due to sync issues

**Enforcement**: Architecture — repositories always read/write Room, SyncManager handles Firestore asynchronously.

---

### S-2: Offline Queue Persistence

**Writes made while offline must eventually reach Firestore.**

**Rule**: Firestore SDK's built-in offline cache persists pending writes to disk. Writes are automatically flushed when connectivity returns.

**Enforcement**: Firestore SDK (automatic). The app does not manage its own pending change queue.

---

### S-3: Conflict Resolution

**Concurrent modifications resolved by last-write-wins.**

**Rule**: When the same document is modified on two devices, the write with the later `updatedAt` timestamp wins. Firestore applies the last write it receives.

**Rationale**: Single-user app with sequential interactions. Real conflicts are vanishingly rare. Manual conflict resolution adds complexity without meaningful benefit.

**Enforcement**: Firestore default behavior + `updatedAt` timestamp on all entities.

---

### S-4: Authentication Required for Sync

**All Firestore operations require valid Firebase Auth session.**

**Rules**:
- Sync disabled if user not signed in
- Firestore security rules reject unauthenticated requests
- Auth state change (sign out) stops snapshot listeners
- App continues to function fully via Room when not authenticated

**Enforcement**: Firebase Auth state observer + Firestore security rules.

---

### S-5: Data Isolation

**Each user can only read and write their own data.**

**Rules**:
- All Firestore data lives under `users/{userId}/` path
- Security rules enforce `request.auth.uid == userId`
- Pi dashboard uses Admin SDK (privileged access for a trusted device)

**Enforcement**: Firestore security rules.

---

## Domain Invariants (ADHD Principles)

### D-1: No Streak Display

**System never calculates, stores, or displays streak counts.**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Forbidden["Never Display"]
        F1["Current streak: 5 days"]
        F2["Longest streak: 21 days"]
        F3["Streak broken!"]
    end
    
    subgraph Allowed["Allowed Metrics"]
        A1["Completed 4 of 7 this week"]
        A2["85% completion rate"]
        A3["Active for 30 days"]
    end
```

**Rule**: No streak-related fields or calculations anywhere in the system.

---

### D-2: No Punitive Messaging

**All user-facing text must be shame-free.**

| Forbidden Phrases | Allowed Alternatives |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "You failed" | "Let's figure this out" |
| "Streak broken" | (Never mention) |
| "You missed X days" | "Ready when you are" |
| "Try harder" | "What would help?" |
| "Don't give up" | "Welcome back" |

**Rule**: All strings pass shame-free review (see Messaging Guidelines).

---

### D-3: No Gamification

**System has no points, badges, levels, or leaderboards.**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Forbidden["Never Implement"]
        F1["Points for completion"]
        F2["Badges/achievements"]
        F3["Levels/XP"]
        F4["Leaderboards"]
        F5["Streak bonuses"]
    end
    
    subgraph Allowed["Allowed Feedback"]
        A1["Completion animation"]
        A2["Progress percentage"]
        A3["Encouraging message"]
        A4["Visual checkmark"]
    end
```

**Rule**: Feedback is immediate and intrinsic, not gamified.

---

### D-4: Flexibility Over Rigidity

**Users can always skip, pause, or simplify without penalty.**

**Rules**:
- Skip option always available
- Pause option always available
- No penalty for any of these actions
- Recovery always offered, never forced
